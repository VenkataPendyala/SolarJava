This program does not display the terrestrial bodies in a scale distance or size relationship. The only accurate feature of this model is the relative orbital speeds. For example, Mercury travels slightly more than four times as fast as Earth does, and it is conveyed in the model by about 4 orbits of Mercury per orbit of Earth. 

Note that the positions of the planets are not accurate either (both relative to the sun and to each other). The program starts them at standard position (angle 0), meaning they all begin in line, and there will be times when they all line up once again.
